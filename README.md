This is my first project Recipes from The Odin project in which I create an index with three links to recipes I found interesting.

With this project I'm able to test the basic of HTML language creating elements such 
as different kind of text, inserting images, anchor elements and learning the general structure for an html document. I also put into practice how to add, commit and finally push my project to Github.
