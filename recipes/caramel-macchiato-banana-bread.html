        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Mash bananas in a large mixing bowl with a fork until almost smooth. Stir in coffee creamer, sugar, oil, eggs, and instant coffee granules until coffee granules have dissolved. Gradually stir in flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, until batter is almost smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour. Allow to cool before removing from pan, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the bread is cooling, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix in brown sugar and vanilla and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer syrup for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to a warm but liquid temperature.</li>
            <li>Pour glaze over cooled banana bread. Serve when glaze has set.</li>
        </ol>
